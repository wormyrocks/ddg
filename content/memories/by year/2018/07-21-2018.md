After Dan felt really bummed out after a long day of editing stuff for the F News Magazine site (SAIC's school newspaper), we decided to go out for a walk around UIC's campus. We admired and were in awe of the amount of concrete and the architecture there as the sun was setting, while talking about Mark Fisher's writing. 
 
 I'd like to believe that looking into this never-ending cascade of concrete buildings and ceiling lights from outside ended up inspiring him to make a 3D video piece that evoked this feeling.

We then slowly just walked and walked and made our way to his place in Pilsen. We probably had tacos that night at Taqueria El Mezquite, one of his favorite spots ever, and the place where he introduced me to Mexican food. He loved lengua tacos with lots of onion and cilantro, and went ham on salsa.

I really adore this photo of him that I took!
