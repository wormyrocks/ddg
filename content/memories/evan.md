dan was one of the first friends i made on my own even though we had separate homeroom teachers.

he knew every movie. he knew every video game. every tv show. he loved the earthbound games and the matrix sequels and cave story and metal gear, all sorts of art that celebrated finding and celebrating shared humanity in the face of unspeakable, existential evil, and of course nefarious villains with ridiculous names and silly catchphrases. 

we went to tons of movies together between 2010 and 2015.

he curated constantly and noticed things everyone else missed.

i programmed two video games for which he contributed music.
