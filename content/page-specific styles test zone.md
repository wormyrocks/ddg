here is a directory of page-specific styling tests!

it's possible to add specific css to pages by adding `[data-slug=""]` to  `quartz/styles/custom.scss`. 

for example, if you want to change the color of the text on link hovers on this page, AND override default CSS stylings:

	[data-slug="page-specific-styles-test-zone"] a:hover { color: purple !important; }

[[media slide test]] is where we'll be experimenting to generate a media slide that supports text, and embeds of audio, pictures, and video.
