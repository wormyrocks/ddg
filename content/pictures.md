>  After Dan felt really bummed out after a long day of editing stuff for the F News site (SAIC's school newspaper), we decided to go out for a walk around UIC's campus. We admired and were in awe of the amount of concrete and the architecture there as the sun was setting, while talking about Mark Fisher's writing.

He loved lengua tacos with lots of onion and cilantro, and went ham on salsa.
